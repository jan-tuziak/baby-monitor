# Baby Monitor

A real-time baby monitor web application for streaming audio and video between two phones. Place one phone near your baby and watch/listen from the other. Works on Android and iOS over local network or internet. Supports direct WebRTC and optional server-relayed WebRTC for restrictive networks. Talk back to the baby supported. No data storage.

## Features

- **Session-based isolation** - Multiple monitors on one server, each with unique session name
- **Bookmarkable URLs** - URLs like `/sender/my-session` work every day without prompts
- **Real-time streaming** - Low-latency direct or server-relayed video and audio
- **Optional server relay mode** - Start page can force a built-in server relay when direct WebRTC is blocked
- **Push-to-talk (PTT)** - Talk back to your baby from the parent's phone
- **Audio ducking** - Automatically lowers baby audio during PTT to prevent echo
- **No data storage** - Media is never recorded or stored on the server, even in relay mode
- **Screen wake lock** - Keeps both devices awake while monitoring
- **Visual alerts**:
  - 🟢 Green background when connected
  - 🔴 Red/black flashing overlay with "LOUD SOUND DETECTED" on loud sounds
  - 🔴 Red/black flashing overlay with "CONNECTION LOST" on disconnect
- **Sender screen dimming** - Screen turns black after 5 seconds to save battery, tap to wake
- **Audio level meter** - Visual indicator with threshold marker on receiver
- **Adjustable sensitivity** - Control when loud sound alerts trigger
- **Volume control** - Adjust playback volume on receiver (settings persist)
- **Fullscreen mode** - Immersive viewing on receiver
- **Auto-reconnect** - Automatically reconnects when connection is lost
- **Lullaby playback** - Play music on baby's phone with configurable sleep timer
- **Offline lullaby cache** - Sender caches fetched playlist metadata and songs for offline playback after an online warm-up
- **Music echo reduction** (Experimental) - Reduces music bleedthrough in the audio stream using spectral subtraction
- **No WebSocket required** - Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for signaling, works with simple hosting

## Requirements

- Node.js 21.7.x or higher
- Two devices with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Camera and microphone permissions
- HTTPS for production (required for camera/mic access on non-localhost)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone https://github.com/felschatz/baby-monitor.git
cd baby-monitor

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 2. First Time Setup

1. Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000/`
2. Enter a session name (e.g., "felix-baby") - use the same name for sender and receiver
3. Choose **Direct** or **Server Relay** on the start page for the sender session
4. Click **"Baby's Phone (Sender)"** or **"Parent's Phone (Receiver)"**
5. **Bookmark the URL** (e.g., `/sender/felix-baby`) for easy daily access

### 3. Daily Use (After Bookmarking)

1. Open your bookmarked sender URL on the baby's phone
2. Open your bookmarked receiver URL on your phone
3. Streaming starts automatically - no need to enter session name again

### 4. Sender Setup (Baby's Device)

1. Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000/s/<session-name>` (or use bookmark)
2. Allow camera and microphone access when prompted
3. Select video/audio options (both enabled by default)
4. Streaming auto-starts when connected
5. Screen will dim after 5 seconds of inactivity - tap to wake
6. Open the sender once while online to cache the selected lullaby playlist for offline playback later

### 5. Receiver Setup (Parent's Device)

1. Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000/r/<session-name>` (or use bookmark)
2. The stream connects automatically when sender is available
3. **Tap anywhere** to enable audio (required by browser autoplay policies)
4. Adjust volume and alert sensitivity as needed
5. **Hold the 🎤 button** to talk to baby (Push-to-Talk)

### Landing Page

Navigate to `http://<server-ip>:3000/` for a status page showing active sessions and the session input form.

## Deployment

### Server Requirements

- Node.js 21.x runtime
- HTTPS certificate (required for camera/microphone access)
- SSE support (standard HTTP, no WebSocket upgrade needed)
- Open ports for normal HTTPS traffic and browser WebRTC connectivity to the server
- Relay mode is built into the Node app; no separate TURN service is required

### Deploy with FTP (GitHub Actions)

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) for automated FTPS deployment on push to `main`.

**Required GitHub Secrets:**

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FTP_SERVER` | FTP server hostname |
| `FTP_USERNAME` | FTP username |
| `FTP_PASSWORD` | FTP password |
| `FTP_SERVER_DIR` | Target directory on server |

### Running on a Server

After deploying files, SSH into your server and:

```bash
cd /path/to/baby-monitor

# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Start with PM2 (recommended for production)
pm2 start server.js --name baby-monitor

# Or run directly
node server.js
```

### Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

Example Nginx configuration with SSE support:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name baby-monitor.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        
        # SSE support - disable buffering
        proxy_buffering off;
        proxy_cache off;
        proxy_set_header Connection '';
        chunked_transfer_encoding off;
    }
}
```

### Session Security

Sessions provide access control through secret session names:
- Session names are never broadcast - only used server-side for routing
- Unknown session name = cannot access the stream
- Use a strong session name (8+ random characters) for privacy
- Sessions are not enumerable - other users can't discover your sessions

### Password Protection (Optional)

For additional security, you can add password protection at the web server level:

#### Nginx

```nginx
location / {
    auth_basic "Baby Monitor";
    auth_basic_user_file /path/to/.htpasswd;

    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    # ... other proxy settings
}
```

Create `.htpasswd`:

```bash
htpasswd -c /path/to/.htpasswd username
```

#### Apache (.htaccess)

```apache
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Baby Monitor"
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
Require valid-user
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Server port | `3000` |
| `ENABLE_DEBUG_TIMER` | Show 1-minute timer option for testing | `false` |
Relay mode is built in when the server has the `@roamhq/wrtc` dependency installed.

## Visual Indicators

## Offline Music

- The sender caches the selected playlist metadata and track files after it loads them successfully online
- Cached lullabies are served locally by a sender-only service worker, so the sender can keep playing them without internet access
- First load still requires internet access; offline playback works after the playlist has been warmed into cache once
- If the sender goes offline mid-download, playback now skips uncached tracks and keeps using whatever tracks are already cached

### Receiver (Parent's Phone)

| State | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Connected | Green background |
| Disconnected | Red/black flashing overlay: "CONNECTION LOST" |
| Loud sound | Red/black flashing overlay: "LOUD SOUND DETECTED" |
| Audio meter | Bar with white threshold marker showing current level |
| Music playing | Track name and time remaining under music button |

### Sender (Baby's Phone)

| State | Indicator |
|-------|-----------|
| Connected | Green background |
| Disconnected | Red/black flashing background |
| Streaming | Camera preview visible |
| Screen saving | Black overlay after 5s (tap to wake) |

## How It Works

### Architecture

1. **Signaling Server** - Pure Node.js HTTP server uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for connection setup
2. **Peer-to-Peer Streaming** - Direct connection between devices for lowest-latency media
3. **STUN / TURN Servers** - Direct mode uses optional Cloudflare TURN when ICE cannot establish a peer-to-peer path, with public STUN as the configuration fallback
4. **Optional Server Relay** - The Node server can bridge media through paired WebRTC peer connections when direct paths fail

### Connection Flow

1. Sender connects to `/api/sse/sender/:session` (SSE endpoint)
2. Receiver connects to `/api/sse/receiver/:session` (SSE endpoint)
3. Receiver requests connection via `/api/signal` with `session` in body
4. Server routes messages only within the same session
5. Sender creates offer and sends via signal endpoint
6. Receiver responds with answer
7. ICE candidates are exchanged
8. Direct or server-relayed media connection established

### Direct Mode with Cloudflare TURN (Railway)

Keep the app on Railway and select **Direct** on the sender. In the Railway service's Variables tab, set:

```text
CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_ID=<your Cloudflare Realtime TURN key ID>
CLOUDFLARE_TURN_KEY_API_TOKEN=<the API token for that TURN key>
```

Redeploy, then open `https://<your-railway-domain>/api/webrtc-config?transport=direct`.
The JSON should contain Cloudflare `stun:`, `turn:` and `turns:` URLs and temporary `username` / `credential` values.
The backend uses Node's built-in `fetch` to request credentials with a TTL of 86400 seconds (24 hours), following [Cloudflare's credential API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/turn/generate-credentials/).
The long-lived API token stays on the server and is never returned or logged. Config responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

No relay-only policy is set: ICE prefers a viable direct path and can select TURN when necessary.
If either variable is missing, or Cloudflare fails, returns invalid data, or exceeds the 10-second request timeout, the app logs a warning and uses its existing public STUN configuration.
The configuration endpoint is public, as before; anyone able to access it can obtain temporary TURN credentials. Apply your deployment's access protection to this endpoint as well.

To test, use Android Chrome on Wi-Fi as sender and iPhone Safari with Wi-Fi off as receiver, in the same session.
Check audio/video and talk-back. A returned configuration verifies credential generation; an actual connection verifies the media path.
Both pages retain their loaded configuration; reload both before reconnecting after the 24-hour credentials expire, or after fixing an initial STUN fallback. Automatic credential refresh is not implemented.

### Relay Mode

If you choose **Server Relay** on the sender side, the app keeps WebRTC but replaces the direct browser-to-browser path with two browser-to-server peer connections. The Node server bridges sender media to each receiver and also bridges the PTT return audio back to the sender. Receivers learn the correct transport mode automatically from the active sender session before requesting an offer.

Cloudflare TURN is used only by Direct mode. Server Relay still requires the Node host to support inbound WebRTC media traffic; use Direct with TURN on Railway.

### Push-to-Talk Flow

1. Parent holds 🎤 button on receiver
2. Receiver adds audio track and renegotiates connection
3. Sender receives audio and plays through speaker
4. Parent releases button, track is removed

### Lullaby Playback

1. Add MP3 files to playlist folders under `mp3/` (e.g., `mp3/1/`, `mp3/2/`, etc.)
2. Select a playlist from the dropdown (both sender and receiver remember your choice)
3. Parent taps 🎵 button and selects timer duration
4. Sender shuffles playlist and plays through speaker
5. Music stops automatically when timer expires
6. Parent can stop manually by tapping the stop button

### Music Echo Reduction (Experimental)

When lullabies are playing on the baby's phone, the music can bleed through the microphone into the audio stream. The "Reduce music echo" feature attempts to reduce this:

1. Enable "Reduce music echo" checkbox on receiver
2. Start music playback
3. Sender analyzes both the music and microphone audio using FFT
4. Music frequencies are attenuated from the mic signal before streaming
5. Baby sounds should still come through while music is reduced

**Note:** This is experimental. Results vary depending on speaker/mic placement and room acoustics. The feature uses ScriptProcessorNode (deprecated but widely supported) for real-time processing.

**Playlist Structure:**
```
mp3/
├── 1/                    # Playlist 1 (default)
│   ├── name.txt          # Contains "German Lullabies"
│   ├── lullaby.mp3
│   └── twinkle.mp3
├── 2/                    # Playlist 2
│   ├── name.txt          # Contains "Lofi Hiphop"
│   ├── ocean.mp3
│   └── rain.mp3
└── 3/                    # Playlist 3
    └── white_noise.mp3   # No name.txt = "Playlist 3"
```

Add a `name.txt` file to each folder to give it a custom display name.

## Privacy & Security

- **No data storage** - Video/audio is never recorded or persisted on the server
- **Direct mode** - Uses Cloudflare STUN/TURN when configured; media can flow through Cloudflare TURN when a direct path is unavailable
- **Relay mode** - Media goes through the built-in server relay on your infrastructure
- **Fallback STUN servers** (Cloudflare absent or unavailable):
  - `stun.stunprotocol.org:3478`
  - `stun.nextcloud.com:443`
  - `stun.sipgate.net:3478`
- **Always use HTTPS** - Required for camera/mic access and prevents eavesdropping
- **Always password protect** - Prevent unauthorized access to your baby's stream

## Troubleshooting

### Sender phone turns off or sleeps

The app uses multiple keep-awake mechanisms (Wake Lock API, background video, silent audio), but Android can still kill apps aggressively. For reliable overnight monitoring:

**Required settings on the sender (baby's) phone:**

1. **Disable battery optimization for Chrome**
   - Settings → Apps → Chrome → Battery → "Unrestricted" (not "Optimized")
   - This prevents Android from killing Chrome in the background

2. **Disable auto power-off**
   - Settings → Battery → Auto power off → OFF
   - Some phones have scheduled shutdown - disable it

3. **Lock the app in recent apps**
   - Open recent apps (swipe up or square button)
   - Find Chrome, tap the lock icon or long-press → "Lock"
   - This prevents the app from being killed when memory is low

4. **Keep the phone plugged in**
   - Use a reliable charger and cable
   - Some cheap cables disconnect intermittently

5. **Disable "Adaptive battery"** (optional but recommended)
   - Settings → Battery → Adaptive battery → OFF
   - This feature learns to kill "unused" apps

**For Samsung phones:**
- Also disable "Put unused apps to sleep" in Device Care → Battery

**For Xiaomi/MIUI:**
- Settings → Battery → App battery saver → Chrome → "No restrictions"
- Also check Security app → Permissions → Autostart → enable Chrome

### Camera/Microphone not working

- Ensure you've granted permissions in browser settings
- HTTPS is required for media access on mobile (localhost is exempt for testing)
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check if another app is using the camera

### Connection not establishing

1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Ensure both devices can reach the server
3. Try refreshing both pages (sender first, then receiver)
4. Verify STUN servers are accessible (not blocked by firewall)
5. If direct peer-to-peer is blocked on Railway, configure Cloudflare TURN and keep **Direct** selected
6. Check `/api/webrtc-config?transport=direct` for TURN URLs and temporary credentials, then reload both pages

### No audio on parent talk-back (PTT)

1. On sender (baby's phone), tap the screen to enable audio playback
2. Check browser console for "PTT" related logs
3. Ensure microphone permission granted on parent's phone
4. Try releasing and pressing the PTT button again

### Audio plays through speaker instead of headphones

WebRTC audio is classified as "communication audio" by mobile browsers, which may route to the speaker even with headphones connected.

1. **Check phone audio settings** - Look for call/communication audio routing options in Settings → Sound
2. **For Bluetooth headphones** - Ensure both "Media audio" AND "Phone audio" are enabled in the Bluetooth device settings
3. **Try wired headphones** - They often have more reliable audio routing than Bluetooth

### Loud sound alerts not working

1. Tap anywhere on the receiver page first (enables AudioContext)
2. Check the white threshold marker on the audio meter
3. Adjust sensitivity slider - higher value = more sensitive (lower threshold)
4. Check browser console for "Loud sound detected" logs

### Video not showing / black screen

1. Check sender is streaming (green background, preview visible)
2. Tap the receiver screen to enable video playback
3. Check browser console for track and connection state logs
4. Try disabling hardware acceleration in browser

### High latency

- WebRTC provides low latency, but network conditions matter
- Try disabling video for audio-only monitoring
- Check your internet connection speed on both devices
- Ensure devices are on the same network for best results

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 21.x (pure http module, no frameworks)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, WebRTC API
- **Signaling**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) + HTTP POST
- **NAT Traversal**: Optional Cloudflare STUN/TURN in Direct mode, public STUN fallback, and optional built-in server-side WebRTC relay
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions with FTPS
